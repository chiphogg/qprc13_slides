# Overview

The basic story is this.

We've got a metal plate, and we stretch it.  So there's some amount of strain at every point on this surface.  We've measured this strain function at a bunch of points, but we wish we knew it everywhere.  We wish we knew this _strain surface_, if you like.  We have some idea about it, but we're not completely certain.

quantify uncertainty
  probabilities on functions??
visualize uncertainty
reduce uncertainty
